# Mortgage Delinquency Rate Analysis (2008–2025)

This project is a comprehensive data science study focused on the US mortgage market.

## 🎯 Objectives

Technical Showcase: Demonstrate advanced data visualization and web-based dashboarding skills using the Python ecosystem.

Trend Analysis: Identify and analyze mortgage delinquency patterns across different States and Counties over a 17-year period (2008–2025).

## 📉 Why This Matters
Mortgage delinquency rate is an early indicator of potential danger or failure for the economy. By tracking these rates, we can:

Assess the overall health of the mortgage market.

Identify regions experiencing economic distress before they impact the broader market.

Understand the long-term recovery cycles following major events like the 2008 Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

## 🛠️ The Process
*1. Data Acquisition*  
Data is retrieved programmatically from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), specifically their "Mortgage Performance Trends" dataset.

*2. Data Wrangling*  
Cleaning, Formatting, and Aggregation

*3. Data Visualization*  
Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for initial exploratory analysis:

Line Graphs: Tracking delinquency spikes and dips from 2008 to 2025.

Pie Charts: Visualizing the distribution of delinquency stages (e.g., 30–89 days vs. 90+ days).

*4. Interactive Dashboard*  
The project culminates in a real-time interactive dashboard built with Dash and Plotly.

US Choropleth Map: A color-coded map showing delinquency intensity by state.

Dynamic Filtering: Users can drill down from national trends to specific counties.

## 🚀 Results & Demo
The final dashboard features a three-row layout designed for a high-level executive view and deep-dive granular analysis.
